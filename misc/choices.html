<h1>Effects of technology in education</h1>


<p>A recent survey has shown that the use of technology within classes has risen by 55% from 2016, with 86% of teachers, lectures and other educators using a laptop to teach in class. This rapid increase shows the importance of technology within classrooms and in education as we become more reliant on both devices and digital services. Although some may argue that technology in education presents some issues such as online addiction and being easily distracted, many others believe that it is important to embrace it due to its ever-growing uses. </p>

	<p>In the next five years it is predicted that devices such as tablets and laptops will replace traditional textbooks, with more and more educators becoming tech literate. The future shows that educators will need to be tech literate to teach more effectively as traditional methods will eventually become obsolete. Educators in the future may be required to have experience with using technology through university papers or at the very least be forced to take courses which teach tech literacy. It will become crucial to become tech literate in a world where educators already rely on online services such as blackboard to provide students with information. In just 10 years technology has progressed so quickly that teachers who were once tech literate may be clueless when it comes to using services such as blackboard and other cloud services such as google cloud. As early as 1998 the education sector in North America saw a large influx of investments towards technology in education as they saw the enhancements technology could bring to everyone. As technology keeps progressing, future educators will need to keep up with new advancements and services so that they can effectively teach students. Students will also have to learn how to use new services such as cloud services.  </p>
	<p>One advancement we may see in the future is the use of augmented or virtual reality to teach and learn. Augmented and virtual reality has been steadily developing over the past couple of years, with many consumer headsets from companies such as HTC and Samsung being sold. Virtual reality is still a fairly new industry as it is yet it has become popular due to its many applications. Although the current virtual reality market is heavily catered towards gaming, medical educators have adopted the use of headsets to teach skills such as surgery on patients. The use of VR will only continue to grow as it becomes more refined. Augmented reality is also another virtual form used to teach. Augmented reality has an estimated growth from 48.92 billion dollars to 67.63 billion dollars between 2020 and 2021. This growth is attributed to the reliance of online services due to the covid 19 pandemic as businesses rely on such services. However augmented reality has seen a surge in popularity within the education sector due to its versatility in teaching. Google has developed an augmented reality view for teaching, which helps teachers be able to explain a subject better by providing a visual representation of the material they are showing. Many educators already see the potential of augmented and virtual reality with 90% of educators saying that they believe virtual reality is an effective teaching method.</p>
	
	<p>Assistive tools are an important development in education as it helps those with disabilities learn easily. Features such as text to speech and systems such as the sit and puff system help students who have impaired motor abilities to learn. Proofreading software can be used to help those who suffer from dyslexia help write grammatically correctly. Technology has become an integral part in those who have disabilities as it helps them learn easier. The future in assistive technology shows a trend of using more IOT integrated parts to aid those with disabilities become more independent. Things such as doors and elevators may integrate IOT so that people with limited motor skills can roam around campuses easily. Another development in assistive technology is teachers and educators gaining special qualifications that help children with special needs such that more educators are available to teach.
