<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

	<p>Personally, although computers are a great resource to education, it has its risks. As children are introduced to computers and other communication devices, we are introducing them to the internet. Many may be accessing the net without any parent supervision. Although some sites may have restrictions a child is able to access any sites that are not allowed to watch. Students may be exposed to cyber bullying and threats, and this may be mentally disturbing. Children are exposing themselves to greater world of risk and allowing them to grow up faster then they should. Referencing and copying may be hard to distinguish very young as well. Privacy on social media maybe breached as well.</p>
