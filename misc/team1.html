<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

	<p>Personally, although computers are a great resource to education, it has its risks. As children are introduced to computers and other communication devices, we are introducing them to the internet. Many may be accessing the net without any parent supervision. Although some sites may have restrictions a child is able to access any sites that are not allowed to watch. Students may be exposed to cyber bullying and threats, and this may be mentally disturbing. Children are exposing themselves to greater world of risk and allowing them to grow up faster then they should. Referencing and copying may be hard to distinguish very young as well. Privacy on social media maybe breached as well.</p>
	<p>Overall, I believe although the issues, computers continue to be very important to me personally in my education. Education to children of safe surfing or monitoring children’s safety and honesty and integrity I believe will help in dealing with ethical issues surrounding computers and education. Teaching children at a young age with basic right or wrong or discipline and understanding I believe will help students to identify between good and bad while browsing the net.</p>
	<p>My recommendations for such ethics would be for schools to build their own student safe apps and platforms for students to use, restricting various prohibited sites for students to access and teaching referencing and importance of copyright in schools to avoid copy paste and reference checks to be more implemented. Parents to also monitor children’s social media and data usage times to have some control. </p>
	<p>Computers will be needed now more than ever before, ensuring a sage usage will allow a more conducive learning environment.</p>
