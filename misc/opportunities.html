<h1>Computer and Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><p>Access to computer and technology is not equally distributed worldwide. Considerable debate has been in conversation about the growing space gaps between information-rich and information-poor. As the world continues to suffer from the Covid-19 pandemic, we are continuing to see the rise of the need of the need for the use of computers and technology in education. <p>

<p>Computers were visioned to be an indispensable part of the educational process that initially started in the mid-20th Century has now been fully utilised today. Computers and Education continue to be a growing field in today’s world. Computers have had an enormous impact in our communities, particularly in education. According to Tatnall (2017), computers in education were brought about by people, organisations, and technologies for a better change in the way we did things. Computers have in fact, had a significant impact on the society, mostly related to computers in education were there were different society impacts. The significance of the computer had an impact on society even before the internet, Google, Wikipedia, and smart phones in the late 1900s and 2000s (Tatnall, 2017). </p>

	<p>Many studies were conducted on computer-based education, studies included paper surveys on the benefits of computer-based education. Benefits of computer-based benefits included, self-paced learning, exercise of different senses, representation of study materials through a variety of content. Other studies proved that learners learnt in various ways, finding their comfort of learning, enabled a better understanding and in turn a better academic performance. Computers also allow for students to learn and study at a place conducive and productive for them in their own personal space. Less travel time to educational institutions allows for more study time. Students can choose a time where they were mentally and physically prepared to study instead of following a structed timetable that is not suitable for students at times for personal reasons. Such availability of resources in turn allows for the availability of increased resources and the ability to process more information, allowing a student to feel more accomplished with various tasks. People as individuals learn better in various approaches, people only remember very little of what they hear, but they can remember twice as much with visuals and images.  The use of the play back videos and lectures triggers more memory for students to remember course content.</p>

	<p>The significant progress in the availability of advanced graphics and machines have allowed many students to be more equipped with technology more than ever before (Kolmanic et al. 2000). Computers can now motivate the students, knowing they are comfortable with using various devices such as computers, tablets, iPads and many more communication tools and devices. This is greatly since kids nowadays are accustomed to gadgets at a very young age, recently even before they attend school. Various platforms allow for a student and teacher to communication in and out of the classroom allowing more time for questions and may in turn show a better academic performance. Positive impacts that contributed to the societal impacts are education, school administration and some student’s behaviours. Many parents are now able to admit that their children are fully equipped with knowledge on how to work with computers. Some parents find that their children can teach them how to use technology (Tatnall, 2017). The significant growth in the use of computer in education in the 21st Century has enabled students and children to be fully equipped to stay connected.</p>
	
	<p>This use of computers and technology in schools every day, has enabled students to be able to connect and continue their education through the Covid-19 pandemic. Computers have recently played a vital role in education, especially through the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic however fortunately occurred at a time where technology is used daily. Such include, internet connections, applications for processing data and various forms of communication tools that have been used immensely all over the world (Gaudiot, 2020). It is quite amazing that most universities around the world were able to continue to offer education without much disruption with the help of technology. Most universities, colleges and schools were able to equip themselves to conduct long-distance education through stay-at-home orders. Students were able to communicate freely with teachers at their convenience via email or various platforms that enabled them to communicate with their lecturers. </p>
	<p>Computers have successfully become part of the teaching and learning process in many schools globally. From a personal experience, Auckland University of Technology (AUT) was able to use Blackboard and Microsoft Teams to be able to hold real time virtual classes to try and enhance or grasp an in-class experience. Although I initially found this quite challenging, the availability of playback of resources allowed for a successful academic year. Computers and technology are an important part of education and will continue to be a growing need in the use of computers in education.</p>
