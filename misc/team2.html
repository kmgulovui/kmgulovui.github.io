<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>
	<p>I believe that technology is a vital part of education as it has had a profound impact on the way we learn and receive information. Although some are quick to point out the negatives that technology holds, I believe that the positives heavily outweigh the negatives.</p>
	<p>Technology has become such a vital part of our lives and as a result we must embrace it and learn to use it to the fullest advantage. Technology in education has already seen a heavy increase in the accessibility for those who would usually be unable to use online devices and services. Technology in education provides those with disabilities the chance to learn the same as everyone else and connect with others through the internet. Services such as blackboard and canvas are an important tool used to provide information such as lectures and notes that otherwise would be inaccessible. The recent pandemic has shown our heavy reliance on the internet and connectivity with others in order to learn. If it weren't for the internet and online services we would most likely have had to rely on analog methods such as textbooks and hand written notes, which would be inconvenient and not very practical.</p>
	<p>Some negatives that people talk about is the fact that students become easily distracted as a result of using devices such as laptops, however I believe that students will eventually learn to focus better as we become more accustomed to online learning. Educators could also implement methods to make sure the student is paying attention such as non intrusive web filters or monitors to ensure students stay on task. Another negative that some may point out is the feeling of isolation due to online learning, however I believe that this can be negated if online communication such as video or voice calls with other students are encouraged. At the start of this semester I was afraid that I was going to feel isolated and alone however being sorted into random groups and being encouraged to talk to others negated these feelings.</p>
	<p>In conclusion, technology in education and technology in general is an important part of our lives that we shouldn't look down upon. It brings many positives that aids others in many ways which otherwise would be impossible.</p>
