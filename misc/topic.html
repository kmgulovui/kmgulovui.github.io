<h1>Computing and Technology in Education</h1>


</ul><h5><p>We have chosen this topic because of our ever growing reliance on computers and other types of technology in education. The recent pandemic has shown the importance of having access and being able to use online services and various forms of technology to learn. </p></h5>
<h5><p>Our research will build a case on the positive impacts of the use of computers in education such as the ease of accessibility and collaboration with others. We will also look at its negative impacts such as distraction and addiction.</p></h5>
