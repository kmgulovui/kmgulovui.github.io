<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>First, in online education, it is difficult for students to be emotionally affected by computer 
	screens, which means that studentsâ€™ emotions and thoughts are difficult to follow the teacher, 
	and they are also easily affected by other things around them, such as mobile phone ringtones. 
	The second point will also increase the time cost. For example, when there are any questions, 
	the teacher will basically not answer the questions one by one in the online class. Students can 
	only send emails to ask some questions, which invisibly increases some time costs. The third and 
	most important point is that some teachers will only follow the teaching materials in the 
	classroom, and will not change according to the characteristics of online teaching. Some education 
	models may not be suitable for online, which leads to students The learning experience and learning 
	effect are not as good as offline classrooms. I have surveyed some students, and about 70% of the 
	students believe that online classrooms are not as effective as offline classrooms.</em></h4><br>
