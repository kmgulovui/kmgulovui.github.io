<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>Through the efforts of our group this time, I have learned a lot. For example, when encountering difficulties, it is not enough to rely solely on the strength of one person. It is necessary for team members to overcome the problems together and help each other. I think our group is the most energetic and creative group. Our small group is also very clear. I am responsible for the shortcomings and risks of online education. I collected a lot of information online, and then summarized it.</em></h4><br>
