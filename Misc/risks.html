<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>First, in online education, it is difficult for students to be emotionally 
	affected by computer screens, which means that studentsâ€™ emotions and thoughts 
	are difficult to follow the teacher, and they are also easily affected by other 
	things around them, such as mobile phone ringtones. The second point will also 
	increase the time cost. For example, when there are any questions, the teacher 
	will basically not answer the questions one by one in the online class. Students 
	can only send emails to ask some questions, which invisibly increases some time 
	costs. The third and most important point is that some teachers will only follow 
	the teaching materials in the classroom, and will not change according to the 
	characteristics of online teaching. Some education models may not be suitable 
	for online, which leads to students The learning experience and learning effect 
	are not as good as offline classrooms. I have surveyed some students, and about 
	70% of the students believe that online classrooms are not as effective as offline 
	classrooms.<p></h4>
